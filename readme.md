In this project we have designed a server
using the principles of Restful api where 
we utilised the principles of all Http methods


Http Methods used in this project : 

1. GET /users -> list all the users

2. GET /users/1 -> list the user with id = 1
   GET /users/:id -> here id can be anything basciall a variable


3. POST /users-> create new user  for post requests i used postman for sending requests

4. PATCH /user/1-> updates the users data with id = 1

5. Delete /user/1 -> Delete the user with id = 1


NOTE : we have used mokaro.com to create Fake data for testing purpose
